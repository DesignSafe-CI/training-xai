In the presence of gently sloping ground or near the free face of a slope, the occurrence of earthquake-induced liquefaction may generate lateral displacements, known as lateral spreading."

        "Classification is the task of predicting a categorical target variable based on input data. There are two main types of classification:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Binary classification**: The target variable has two possible classes, often labeled 0 and 1. The goal is to predict which of the two classes an input belongs to. Examples include spam detection, disease diagnosis, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-class classification**: The target variable has more than two possible discrete values or classes. The goal is to predict the specific class an input belongs to out of the multiple choices. Examples include image recognition, document categorization, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a test on a feature (e.g., \"is feature A > 5?\"), each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. A decision tree is a supervised learning model used for both binary and multi-class classification. It works by recursively partitioning the input space into smaller subspaces based on the value of different predictor variables. The goal is to create leaf nodes that contain cases with similar values of the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of learning a decision tree involves selecting features and split points that best separate the classes, based on a criterion such as information gain or Gini impurity. It continues until a stopping criterion is met, like reaching a maximum depth or a minimum number of samples per leaf.\n",
        "\n",
        "The structure of a decision tree consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "  *  __Root node__: This is the topmost node in the tree and contains the full dataset.\n",
        "  *  __Internal nodes__: These represent points where the data is split based on values of predictor variables.\n",

        "\n",
        "A decision tree decides a split by selecting a feature and a value to divide the dataset into two or more homogenous subsets, according to a certain criterion. The ultimate goal is to find the splits that produce the purest subsets, meaning that each subset ideally contains data points from only one class. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Selection of Criteria**: The method used to decide a split depends on the criterion being used. Common criteria for classification tasks include Gini Impurity, Information Gain, and Chi-Squared. For regression tasks, variance reduction is often used.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Evaluate Each Feature and Potential Split**: For each feature in the dataset, the algorithm calculates the criterion's value for every potential split point. Split points can be the actual values of a continuous feature or different categories of a categorical feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Choose the Best Split**: The algorithm selects the feature and split point that produces the subsets with the highest purity according to the chosen criterion. For example:\n",
        "        In the case of Gini Impurity, the best split minimizes the impurity.\n",
        "        In the case of Information Gain, the best split maximizes the gain.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Create Subsets**: Once the best split has been identified, the dataset is divided into subsets according to the chosen feature and split point.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Repeat**: Steps 1-4 are repeated recursively on each of the subsets until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a certain tree depth or the subsets being pure enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example Using Gini Impurity\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For each feature, consider all possible values for splitting.\n",
        "  - Choose the split that results in the lowest weighted Gini Impurity.\n",
        "  - Calculate the Gini Impurity for each possible split as:\n",
        "  - Divide the dataset accordingly and continue the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of decision trees, the splitting process is essential as it helps the model generalize the pattern from the training data, enabling accurate predictions or classifications for unseen data. It's the core step in building the tree, and different algorithms might have variations in the splitting procedure."
